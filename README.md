### How to compile

If you download the source and open it , you can edit the links at the top of Form1.vb. Then Build release. You only need the ".exe". Anything else in the release needed by the the launcher will be downloaded.

### How to downloading the EXE

If you don't want to compile the EXE your self than you can go to [Releases](https://github.com/dady172172/KeathsWowLauncher/releases "Here") and download the latest and it will work just fine. Keep in mind the Website and Discord buttons will not work.
